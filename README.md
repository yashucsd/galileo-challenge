Prerequisites:
- python installed
- cookies enabled

Installation steps, from the directory "galileo-challenge":
- `pip install -e .`
- `export FLASK_APP=__init__.py`
- `python -m flask run`
- it should be up on your local host as described by the terminal response

Future considerations:
As I was limited by school work, other interviews, and the scope of the project, I didn't implement the following that I would certainly consider in the case of more, dedicated time and infrastructure.
- making requests to the API in a more sparse fashion
- writing tests
- a more useful user interface
- special styling (beyond bootstrap)
