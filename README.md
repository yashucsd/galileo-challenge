#### Prerequisites:
- python installed
- cookies enabled

#### Installation steps
_from the directory "galileo-challenge"_

- `pip install -e .`
- `export FLASK_APP=__init__.py`
- `python -m flask run`
- it should be up on your local host as described by the terminal response

#### Future considerations:
_As I was limited by school work, other interviews, and the scope of the project, I didn't implement the following that I would certainly consider in the case of more, dedicated time and infrastructure._

- making requests to the API in a more sparse fashion
- writing tests
- a more useful user interface
- special styling (beyond bootstrap)
- mobile friendly/responsive
